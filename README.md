# MDE-ConflictResolution

**Final Project of Model-Driven Engineering Project course.**

**University of L'Aquila - Master Degree course**

The projects here try to address the problem of conflicts that can arise on collaborative (Model Driven Engineering) models editing.

* The **EMFCompare** will, in first place, find the conflicts between an original model _O_ and two different updated versions _L_ and _R_ (all conform to a given _meta-model MM_).
* An _High-order transformation_ (HOT) made with **Acceleo** (model-to-text) will generate the _ad-hoc_ **ATL transformation**
* The resulting ATL transformation will handle and resolve the confilcts between models.
